# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (refreshed 2026-04-26 after cross-repo split)

**Core value:** Users can find any dataset in the catalog in seconds — search, see it on a map, understand what it is, and get it out in the format they need.
**Current focus:** v13.1 Open-Core Separation P1 — closing 6 boundary/seam debts from `docs-internal/audits/oc-separation-deferred-items-20260426.md` before the first paid customer.

## Current Position

Audit-router enterprise-gating WIP parked on `wip/audit-enterprise-gate` branch (3 export tests need community/enterprise mode split before that ships).
